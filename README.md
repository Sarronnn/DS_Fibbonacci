# Homework 1

Due 2/10/21 at 11:59 pm.

This assignment is to be completed individually.

Get ready for some Java practice! This assignment features 5 functions to implement in Java. 

In the hw1.java file, javadocs are provided with a description for each problem. The functions are titled.

1. fibonacci
2. sorter
3. pigLatin
4. hasTriple
5. isPrime

In addition to the hw1.java file, you are provided with a hw1_test.java file, that contains *partial* unit tests for this assignment. I would *highly* recommend writing additional unit tests to further test the functionality of each function.

Requirements
1. You may not use any data structure from the Java collections framework.
2. Your class and project structure must remain named exactly as provided, and you must submit it as such (please dont change the package or file structure, or the names of any functions).
3. Reminder that this is an individual assignment. You may NOT share code with each-other. However, it is perfectly acceptable to discuss programmatic approaches to problems.

To get started:
1. Navigate your terminal or command prompt to the directory you want to save this assignment.
2. Type " git clone *insert url here for copying* ", with the url coming from the Code -> url button
3. In Eclipse, navigate: File > Open Projects from File Systems > Find folder "homework1Eclipse" > Select Folder > Finish. Make sure you have homework1Eclipse selected, and not the repository.
Note: If you import the homework1 folder instead, you will likely get errors as you try to type code! 
4. Code away!


Reminder to upload to github (commit frequently!) and to turn it in on time. If there are any questions, feel free to reach out and ask, or ask any of the Keck lab TAs!
